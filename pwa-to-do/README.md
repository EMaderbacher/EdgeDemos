➡️ **[Open the demo](https://microsoftedge.github.io/Demos/pwa-to-do/)** ⬅️

**PWA To Do** is a simple to do list PWA app that lets you create lists of tasks locally in your browser, or by installing the app.

The data storage is done by using the [WebAssembly build of SQLite3](https://sqlite.org/wasm/).

## TODO

* When editing a task, make it possible to add a reminder. Could use the background sync ability to notify user even when the app is not used.
* Also add ability to attach a file to a task. Stored in IndexedDB.
* Add a manifest.
* Add a way to export DB to disk, and reload from file.
