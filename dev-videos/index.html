          We’re very excited to announce the new Detached Elements tool in
          Microsoft Edge DevTools which will help you investigate and resolve
          DOM memory leaks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Memory leaks occur when the JavaScript code of an application retains
          more and more objects in memory that it doesn’t need any longer
          instead of releasing them for the browser to garbage collect.
        </p>
        <p>
          We built this tool with our friends at Microsoft Teams, and it has
          already helped us find and fix memory leaks across many of our own
          websites and apps.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can find documentation about the tool

        <h2>Grab colors from anywhere on the screen with the EyeDropper API</h2>

          The Microsoft Edge team specified and implemented the new EyeDropper
          API in collaboration with the Chromium open-source project, and we'd
          love your
          <a href="https://github.com/WICG/eyedropper-api/issues"
            >feedback about it here</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many creative applications allow users to pick colors from parts of
          the app window or even from the entire screen, typically using an
          eyedropper metaphor. This new API enables authors to use a
          browser-supplied eyedropper in the construction of custom color
          pickers on the web.
